    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living 
        penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, 
        reaching 100 cm (39 in) in length and weighing from 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). Feathers of the 
        head and back are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, 
        pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches.

        Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. While hunting, 
        the species can remain submerged around 20 minutes, diving to a depth of 535 m (1,755 ft).

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>
        The emperor penguin is found in the Ross Sea, the Weddell Sea, the Bellingshausen Sea, the Amundsen Sea, and the Southern Ocean. 
        It is the only penguin species that breeds on Antarctica, and is the only penguin species that breeds in the Southern Hemisphere.

    <!-- A paragraph about the emperor penguin's behavior -->
    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <p>
        A mature adult travels throughout most of the year between the breeding colony and ocean foraging areas. 
        The species disperses into the oceans from January to March.
        An efficient swimmer, the emperor penguin exerts pressure with both its upward and downward strokes while 
        swimming. The upward stroke works against buoyancy and helps maintain depth. Its average swimming speed is 6–9 km/h (3.7–5.6 mph). 
        On land, the emperor penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling 
        gait and tobogganing—sliding over the ice on its belly, 
        propelled by its feet and wing-like flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless.
